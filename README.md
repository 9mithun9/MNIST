Overview

This Jupyter notebook (MNIST_Prediction_Model.ipynb) implements a basic workflow for loading and exploring the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9) and is commonly used for training image classification models. This notebook sets up the environment, installs required libraries, loads the dataset, and provides initial data exploration steps.

Purpose

The notebook serves as a starting point for building a neural network to classify handwritten digits. It currently includes:





Installation of TensorFlow.



Importing necessary libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).



Loading and inspecting the MNIST dataset.

Future stepswould typically include preprocessing the data, defining a model, training, and evaluating it.

Prerequisites





Environment: The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab with Python 3 and GPU acceleration (T4 GPU specified in metadata).



Dependencies: The following Python libraries are required:





tensorflow (version 2.18.0 or compatible)



numpy



pandas



matplotlib



Hardware: A GPU is recommended for faster computation, though the current code (data loading) runs efficiently on CPU as well.

Setup Instructions





Open in Google Colab:





Upload MNIST_Prediction_Model.ipynb to Google Colab.



Ensure the runtime is set to Python 3 with GPU acceleration (Edit > Notebook settings > Hardware accelerator > GPU T4).



Install Dependencies:





The notebook includes a cell to install TensorFlow:

pip install tensorflow



Run this cell to ensure TensorFlow and its dependencies are installed. Other required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) are typically pre-installed in Colab.



Verify Imports:





The notebook imports the necessary libraries:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt



Ensure no import errors occur when running this cell.

Usage





Run the Notebook:





Execute the cells in order to:





Install TensorFlow (if not already installed).



Import libraries.



Load the MNIST dataset.



Inspect the dataset size and structure.



Dataset Exploration:





The notebook loads the MNIST dataset using:

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()





x_train: 60,000 training images (28x28 pixels, grayscale).



y_train: Corresponding labels (integers 0–9).



x_test: 10,000 test images.



y_test: Corresponding test labels.



It checks the dataset size with len(x_train) (60,000) and len(x_test) (10,000).



It displays the first training image (x_train[0]) as a 28x28 NumPy array, showing pixel intensities (0–255).



Next Steps:





The notebook stops at data loading and inspection. To build a complete model, you would need to:





Preprocess the data: Flatten images (e.g., reshape to 784-dimensional vectors) and normalize pixel values (e.g., divide by 255).



Define a model: Use keras.Sequential with layers like Dense (e.g., with ReLU and softmax activations).



Compile the model: Use an optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (e.g., sparse_categorical_crossentropy), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).



Train and evaluate: Use model.fit and model.evaluate.



Example model code (not in the notebook but recommended):

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

Cell 5 (Code): Loads the MNIST dataset.



Cell 6 (Code): Outputs the number of training samples (60,000).



Cell 7 (Code): Outputs the number of test samples (10,000).



Cell 8 (Code): Displays the first training image as a NumPy array.

Output





Installation Output: Confirms TensorFlow and dependencies are installed (e.g., tensorflow 2.18.0).



Dataset Size:





Training set: 60,000 images.



Test set: 10,000 images.



Sample Image: Shows x_train[0] as a 28x28 array with pixel values (0–255), representing a handwritten digit (typically a 5 in MNIST).

Limitations





The notebook only covers data loading and basic inspection. It lacks preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.



No visualization of images (e.g., using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow) is included, though Matplotlib is imported.



The model is not yet implemented, so no classification performance metrics are available.

Future Improvements





Add data preprocessing (flattening, normalization).



Implement a neural network model with hidden layers for better accuracy.



Include visualization of sample images using Matplotlib.



Add model training and evaluation steps.



Save the trained model for reuse.
